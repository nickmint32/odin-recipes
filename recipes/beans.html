		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 cup navy beans, soaked overnight and drained</li>
			<li>4 cups water</li>
			<li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
			<li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons molasses</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1/8 teaspoon chili powder</li>
			<li>1 small onion chopped</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Place beans in a large saucepan with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour. </li>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir ketchup, maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and chili powder together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
                        <li>Once beans have simmered for 1 hour, drain, and reserve cooking liquid. Pour beans into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish; stir in chopped onion and molasses mixture. Stir in enough reserved cooking liquid so sauce covers beans by 1/4 inch. </li>
                        <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; reduce heat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and cook 6 hours longer, stirring beans after they have cooked for 3 hours. Once beans are tender and sauce has reduced and is sticky, remove from the oven, stir, recover, and allow to stand 15 minutes before serving. </li>
		</ol>
